st.markdown("""
Ever since sophomore year in University, I’ve been wondering about my next step after I graduate. One thing that stood out for me is how little people talk about where to go for the best job opportunities, and all I heard was how hard it is to get a job.

I have always thought something was off, and not until I saw this dataset that all my doubts were confirmed.

The data I’m about to show you is from Jadarat, a Unified National Employment Platform for the Saudi people to find jobs.

I noticed that the place with the most job opportunities is Riyadh:

The eastern and the western regions also offer great opportunities to get hired.

It’s expected for fresh grads to get no more than 18000 SR Salary.

Another point that I always disliked about spreading misinformation in this topic is that if you had no prior experience, you won't get hired. The graph below contradicts this statement in a big way:

Most of the offerings are asking for fresh graduates, people with 0 years of experience! Such an uplifting view makes me optimistic for the future.

It’s also worth mentioning a fact that I am proud of, Saudi Arabia is rapidly evolving, and what drove this positive change are women. Although the chart below will show you a minor preference towards males, the percentages are almost equal, indicating that both genders are highly active in driving Saudi Arabia to heights never been reached before.

So rest assured that as long as you work hard, and are actively searching, you will for sure find a job.

**Don’t let the muggles get you down!!**
